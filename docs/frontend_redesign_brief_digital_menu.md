# Frontend Redesign Brief – Digital Menu Platform

## 1. Project Context (Read First)
This project is a **mobile-first digital menu and ordering experience** designed for cafés, restaurants, and casual food businesses.

The product is accessed primarily by:
- Customers scanning a **QR code at the table**
- Using their **own phone**
- In a **busy, real-world environment** (noise, rush, staff movement)

The UI must feel:
- Instantly familiar
- Calm and welcoming
- Fast and reliable

This is **not** a food delivery marketplace. It is a **restaurant-owned digital menu**.

---

## 2. Primary Design Goal

> **Create an elegant, calm but energetic UI that customers understand instantly and café owners feel proud to use.**

Success means:
- Zero explanation needed for customers
- Café owners feel it looks "premium" and "professional"
- Works equally well for cafés, restaurants, and takeaways

---

## 3. Key UX Principles (Non‑Negotiable)

### 1. Familiarity beats novelty
- Borrow interaction patterns users already know (e.g. Uber Eats–style ordering flow)
- Avoid experimental gestures or hidden interactions

### 2. Calm first, excitement second
- The UI should **reduce decision fatigue**
- Energy comes from **food imagery and motion**, not loud colors

### 3. Speed is part of the design
- Pages must *feel* instant
- Avoid heavy visual clutter
- Every screen should load and respond quickly on mid-range phones

### 4. One job per screen
- Each screen should answer one clear question:
  - What can I eat?
  - What did I add?
  - Can I send this order?

---

## 4. Visual Direction

### Overall Look
- Elegant
- Warm
- Clean
- Slightly festive, but **never flashy**

Think:
> Modern café menu + premium hospitality brand

Not:
> Food delivery app / fast-food kiosk

---

## 5. Color Palette Direction

### Base Colors (Calm)
- Warm off-white / cream backgrounds
- Soft beige, sand, or light stone tones

### Accent Colors (Energy)
- Deep espresso brown
- Muted terracotta / clay red
- Olive or herb green (used sparingly)

### Rules
- No pure white backgrounds
- No neon or saturated colors
- Accent colors only for:
  - Active states
  - Call-to-action buttons
  - Important highlights

---

## 6. Typography Direction

- Clear hierarchy
- High readability
- Slight personality, not playful

Guidelines:
- Headings: bold, confident, well-spaced
- Body text: comfortable reading size
- Prices: visible but not dominant

Avoid:
- Ultra-thin fonts
- Script or novelty fonts

---

## 7. Core Screens to Design

### A. Menu Browsing (Primary Screen)
Purpose: Help customers quickly decide what to eat

Must include:
- Sticky category navigation (horizontal scroll)
- Large section headers
- Clean menu item cards
- Optional item images

Interaction expectations:
- Entire item card is tappable
- Smooth scroll between sections

---

### B. Item Detail / Add to Order
Purpose: Confirm choice with confidence

Must include:
- Item name
- Image (if available)
- Description
- Price
- Quantity selector
- Clear “Add to Order” action

---

### C. Order / Cart View
Purpose: Review before sending

Must include:
- List of selected items
- Quantity controls
- Total price
- Clear “Send Order” button

Design note:
- Cart should stay hidden until first item is added

---

### D. Order Sent Feedback
Purpose: Reassure the user

Must include:
- Clear confirmation
- Subtle positive feedback (toast / animation)
- No aggressive upselling

---

## 8. Interaction Patterns to Use

Encouraged:
- Sticky headers
- Bottom action bars (contextual)
- Subtle slide / fade animations
- Toast notifications

Avoid:
- Modal overload
- Long forms
- Multi-step wizards

---

## 9. Accessibility & Practical Use

Design must work for:
- One-handed use
- Bright café lighting
- Slightly cracked or older phone screens

Minimum requirements:
- High contrast text
- Large tap targets
- No tiny icons without labels

---

## 10. What NOT to Do

- Do not design like Uber Eats visually
- Do not add unnecessary features
- Do not prioritise admin features over customer flow
- Do not over-brand or decorate

---

## 11. Final Design Check

A design is successful if:
- A customer can place an order without instructions
- A café owner immediately understands the value
- The UI feels calm even when busy

---

## 12. Deliverables Expected

- Mobile-first designs
- Component-based thinking
- Clear spacing and hierarchy
- Reusable design patterns

Focus on **clarity, warmth, and trust**.
